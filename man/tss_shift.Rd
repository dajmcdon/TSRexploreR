\description{
Analyze TSS shifts between samples within a consensus TSR set.
}
\details{
This function assesses the difference between TSS distributions from two distinct samples
in a set of consensus TSRs by calculating the earth mover's distance (EMD) between
them. For this approach, we imagine that the two TSS distributions in questions are piles 
of dirt, and ask how much dirt from one pile we would need to move, how far, and in which 
direction, to mimic the distribution of the other sample. The resulting score is between 
-1 and 1, with larger magnitudes indicating larger shifts and the sign indicating direction 
(negative values indicate upstream shifts and positive values indicate downstream shifts). 
The function also calculates a p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no difference 
(EMD = 0) based on a permutation test.

'sample_1' and 'sample_2' should be the names of the two samples to compare.
For the directions to make sense for the results 'sample_1' should be the control.
  and 'sample_2' the treatment sample.
The results will be stored back in the TSRexploreR object with the name given by
  'comparison_name'.
'tss_threshold' applies a global threshold to remove TSSs below a certain score,
  and 'min_threshold' is the minimal score that both TSRs must have to be considered.
'max_distance' is the maximum distance between two two TSRs to be considered for shifting.
